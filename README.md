### Hi! iÂ´m a Venezuelan IT Engineer who loves programming. 
Currently, i'm focused on frontend web development, but on my way to becoming fullstack. Right now i don't have experience working in startups or anything like that, but I have a lot of motivation to build my own projects as you can see below. I have been fortunate to carry out projects for businesses and institutions that, although they have been my practice, I have been able to charge for them. 
###Contact me! I will be happy to help you with your project
